## Verifiable Credential Revocation List 2020

This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and
high-performance mechanism for publishing the revocation status of Verifiable
Credentials.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list as well.

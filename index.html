The following sections outlines the data model for this document.

      <section>
        <h3>RevocationList2020Status</h3>

        <p>
When an <a>issuer</a> desires to enable revocation for a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, they MAY add a <code>status</code> property
that uses the data model described in this specification.
        </p>

        <table class="simple">

            <th style="white-space: nowrap">Property</th>

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Write privacy considerations.
    </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Write security considerations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Write accessibility considerations.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
    </p>

    <p>
This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Write i18n considerations.
